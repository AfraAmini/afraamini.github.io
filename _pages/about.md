Hi there! I am a doctoral student at [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). I am supervised by Prof. [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) and Prof. [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/). I conduct research in natural language processing and machine learning. My goal is to understand biases of NLP models, and leverage this understanding to build more efficient and controllable systems.  

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed a masters degree in computer science at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch/). I did my undergrad in computer engineering, software engineering major, at the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).
