Hi there! I am a doctoral student at [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). I am supervised by Prof. [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) and Prof. [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/). I conduct research in natural language processing and machine learning. My goal is to understand biases of NLP models, and leverage this understanding to build more efficient and controllable systems.  

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed a masters degree in computer science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/). I did my undergrad in computer engineering, software engineering major, at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).

I like to help Iranian students with their applications to graduate schools. If you are interested in studying NLP in graduate school, feel free to fill in [this](https://forms.gle/hUTRQZSBr5aT4CTb7) form.
